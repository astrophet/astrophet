I! DON'T! WANT! TO! GO! IN!-SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE!!!!

Hi guys!! My name is Theo and I'm super cool. My pronouns are he/him and I'm 15 (MINOR!!!) On ponytown im most known for being one of the hosts of Saint's Laboratories!

╰┈➤ If you see me with supporter I am VERY sorry but I will not be accepting map help requests unless theyre from close friends. This is because when I load a map (such as the Saint's Laboratories map) its common that it will show up on any other server I am party leader in. This is an issue because when building, people usually have save map perms, which means they can easily save my map that me and my buddies worked really hard on.

TL;DR: Sorry, but no map help when I have supporter :[

╰┈➤ If you see me feel free to c + h! I usually have it in my name, but when I dont that's usually because of character limit. I'm usually afk/offtab at docks by the barrels, feel free to come say hi! I may need a whisper or two to grab my attention. Otherwise I'm usually very friendly and open to chit-chat.

╰┈➤ I love my ocs dearly and there's a special place in my heart for every one of them. I ask that you don't try to ship my ocs together becauese it's very likely they already have a designated partner. Also please refrain from being weird about them... crazy that I have to say this, no I wont hear you out on my oc that sews wings on people thanks!

I also really REALLY love all things music. I collect vinyls and CDs, my favourite band is The Beatles, and I really like oxford commas so I added a third thing!

╰┈➤ I personally believe that music is a more accessable way to consume poetry on a regular basis. I /love/ poetry, which makes music just that much more special to me. No, I am not a music snob and I will not think I'm better than you for liking certain music. I think everyone's experience with music is different on purpose. If there were genres that were objectvely good the fun in music would be sucked out!

I am also an artist! I prefer digital art but nothing has ever stopped me from doodling on my schoolwork.

╰┈➤ I don't think I'm the best artist around, as I am learning new things about it every day, however I usually end up proud of my work. I usually draw my ocs, they are my favourite muse!!! I also like to draw fanart for fandoms im in, but this happens rarely.
