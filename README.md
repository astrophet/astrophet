I! DON'T! WANT! TO! GO! IN!-SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE!!!!

Hi guys!! My name is Theo and I'm super cool. My pronouns are he/him and I'm 15 (MINOR!!!)

I really REALLY love all things music. I collect vinyls and CDs, my favourite band is The Beatles, and I really like oxford commas so I added a third thing!

╰┈➤ I personally believe that music is a more accessable way to consume poetry on a regular basis. I /love/ poetry, which makes music just that much more special to me. No, I am not a music snob and I will not think I'm better than you for liking certain music. I think everyone's experience with music is different on purpose. If there were genres that were objectvely good the fun in music would be sucked out!

I am also an artist! I prefer digital art but nothing has ever stopped me from doodling on my schoolwork.

╰┈➤ I don't think I'm the best artist around, as I am learning new things about it every day, however I usually end up proud of my work. I usually draw my boyfriend, he is my favourite muse!!! I also like to draw fanart for fandoms im in, but this happens rarely.
